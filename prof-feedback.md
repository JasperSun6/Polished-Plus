## Week 2B ----------------------

Overall, great start! Great organization with your comments! A few small changes:

- the <h1> should be wrapped around the <img> inside the <header>, the "Community feel" heading should be an <h2>. The secondary line of text in the banner should be a <p>
- There should only be 1 <h1> per page. the headings in the Product Intro and Call to action banner should both be <h2>.
- Avoid using all caps text in HTML. If you want your text to look all caps, use CSS instead
- <p>Â© 2021 Algonquin College</p> --> <small>&copy; 2021 Algonquin College</small>
- The logos in the header/footer should be wrapped in an <a> linking to the home page

## Week 3 ----------------------

Great work! A few suggestions to clean up and simplify your code:

- You can simplify your button styles. You've created two separate classes and have duplicated a number lines of code. To simplify, create on `.btn` class that creates the basic button styles and then create a second `.btn-white` that changes to colour to white. This will help keep things consistent as well.
- The same concept can be applied to the banners as a whole. create a basic `.banner` class that applies basic styles like alignment, color, etc. Then use a secondary class to apply overrides for padding and image.
- Try and be more descriptive with your classes and avoid numbering classes. Instead of `.signUp1` and `.signUp2` use something like `.btn-teal` and `.btn-white` instead. That way someone looking at the code will understand what those classes do.

- Apply base consistent margin to all heading likes in our in class tutorial: `margin: 0 0 1.5rem;`
- `.lorem` style should be applied to all `a` tags
- You should create a basic reusable `.container` class like we did in the class tutorial to apply consistent content width and centering.
  - You should then create a modifier class for the `.container` to make a narrow `.container-text` to insure a more readable line-length.

Your media query for the header and footer is at too small of a screen size. This is causing a wide range of screens to have awkward overlaps of content.

Part 2:

- The font scale in the `28em` media query should be applied as the default style with no media query.

- Make sure to apply the proper `.container` styles to better contain and align your content!
  - You used `justify-content: space-around;` in the footer which does a decent job of spacing things out. But combining `.container` with `justify-content: space-between;` will create a more consistent width and edge alignment.

Try and be more descriptive with your class names! `.text` and `.text-one` are super generic and don't describe what is happening. Also, it is something that would likely be repeated causing conflicts and bugs!

- You can only have one `h1` per page, you have two. The "Affordable Pricing for All" heading should be the `h1`
- The `$` is important text that should be included in the HTML. It marks the numbers as currency. You have used a `::before` which makes it non-readable text, which is inaccessible and removes the important currency context.

- All `input` need a `label` with text content in it. This is important for accessibility. To visually hide the labels, use the `screen-reader-text` styles discussed in class.

You can put the `components` and `modules` folder immediately inside of the `sass` folder. In my tutorial I included the `base` folder to separate the pre-written code from what we were going to make together. Repeating in your own work is not necessary.
